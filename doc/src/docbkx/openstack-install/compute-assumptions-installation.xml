    <title>Packaged Compute Installation with the Image and Identity
        Services</title>
    <para>The manual installation involves installing OpenStack
        Compute from packages on Ubuntu 11.04 or 11.10 as a user named
        nova with root permission. This guide is written with all
        commands prefixed with sudo.</para>
    <para>Our assumptions for this installation are that you have a
        base Ubuntu Server 11.04 or 11.10 ready. For this
        installation, use the following assumptions:</para>

                <para>You need an LVM volume group called
                    "nova-volumes" to provide persistent
                    storage to guest VMs. Either create this
                    during the installation or leave some free
                    space to create it prior to installing
                    nova services.</para>

    <para>This installation process walks through installing a cloud
        controller node and a compute node using a set of packages
        that are known to work with each other. The cloud controller
        node contains all the nova- services including the API server
        and the database server. The compute node needs to run only
        the nova-compute service. You only need one nova-network
        service running in a multi-node install. You cannot install
        nova-objectstore on a different machine from nova-compute,
        although production-style deployments will use an Image
        Service (Glance) server for virtual images so you do not need
        to install nova-objectstore when using the Image
        Service.</para>
