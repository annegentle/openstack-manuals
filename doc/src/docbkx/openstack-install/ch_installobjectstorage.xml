        <title>Installing OpenStack Compute and Image Service</title>
        <para>The OpenStack system has several key projects that are
        separate installations but can work together depending on your
        cloud needs: OpenStack Compute, OpenStack Object Storage,
        OpenStack Identity Service, and OpenStack Image Service. You
        can install any of these projects separately and then
        configure them either as standalone or connected entities.
        This guide walks through a few typical installations and
        offers explanations for common configuration choices.</para>
