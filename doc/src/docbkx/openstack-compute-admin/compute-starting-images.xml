    <title>Starting Images</title>
    <para>Once you have an installation, you want to get images that you can use in your Compute cloud.
        We've created a basic Ubuntu image for testing your installation. First you'll download
        the image, then use "uec-publish-tarball" to publish it:</para>
    
    <literallayout class="monospaced">image="ubuntu1010-UEC-localuser-image.tar.gz"
wget http://c0179148.cdn1.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/ubuntu1010-UEC-localuser-image.tar.gz
tar xvfz $image </literallayout>
        <para>In return you should see this listing.</para>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">maverick-server-uec-amd64-floppy
maverick-server-uec-amd64.img
maverick-server-uec-amd64-loader
maverick-server-uec-amd64-vmlinuz-virtual</literallayout>
        
    
    
    <para>Next you can use glance-upload commands to upload the image to the Image Service.</para>
    
    <para><literallayout class="monospaced">uec-publish-tarball ubuntu1010-UEC-localuser-image.tar.gz dub-bucket amd64</literallayout></para>
    
    <para>The command in return should output three references:<emphasis role="italic">
        emi</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">eri</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic"
            >eki</emphasis>. You will next run nova image-list in order to obtain the ID of the
        image you just uploaded.</para>
    
    
    <para>Now you can schedule, launch and connect to the instance, which you do with the "nova"
        command line. The ID of the image will be used with the <literallayout class="monospaced">nova boot</literallayout>command.</para>
    <para>One thing to note here, once you publish the tarball, it has
        to untar before you can launch an image from it. Using the
        'nova list' command, and make sure the image has its status as
        "ACTIVE".</para>
    
    <para><literallayout class="monospaced">nova image-list</literallayout></para>
    
    <para>Depending on the image that you're using, you need a public key to connect to it. Some
        images have built-in accounts already created. Images can be shared by many users, so it
        is dangerous to put passwords into the images. Nova therefore supports injecting ssh
        keys into instances before they are booted. This allows a user to login to the instances
        that he or she creates securely. Generally the first thing that a user does when using
        the system is create a keypair. </para>
    <para>Keypairs provide secure authentication to your instances. As part of the first boot of
        a virtual image, the private key of your keypair is added to root’s authorized_keys
        file. Nova generates a public and private key pair, and sends the private key to the
        user. The public key is stored so that it can be injected into instances. </para>
    <para>Keypairs are created through the api and you use them as a parameter when launching an
        instance. They can be created on the command line using the following command :
        <literallayout class="monospaced">nova keypair-add</literallayout>In order to list all the available options, you would run :<literallayout class="monospaced">nova help </literallayout>
        Example usage:</para>
    
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
nova keypair-add test > test.pem
chmod 600 test.pem
                    </literallayout>
    
    <para>Now, you can run the instances:</para>
    <literallayout class="monospaced">nova boot --image 1 --flavor 1 --key_name test my-first-server</literallayout>
    <para>Here's a description of the parameters used above:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">--flavor</emphasis> what type of image to create. You
                can get all the flavors you have by running
                <literallayout class="monospaced">nova flavor-list</literallayout></para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>
                <emphasis role="bold">-key_ name</emphasis> name of the key to inject in to the
                image at launch. </para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>          
    <para> The instance will go from “BUILD” to “ACTIVE” in a short time, and you should
        be able to connect via SSH using the 'ubuntu' account, with the password 'ubuntu':
        (replace $ipaddress with the one you got from nova list): </para>
    <para>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">ssh ubuntu@$ipaddress</literallayout></para>
    <para>The 'ubuntu' user is part of the sudoers group, so you can escalate to 'root'
        via the following command:</para>
    <para>
        <literallayout class="monospaced">
                       sudo -i
                   </literallayout>
    </para>
